# iDevice Asset Repository

Hello there!

This repository was initially created as a possible jumping off point for an idea called **J**ail**b**reak **M**anager (JBM), but I am unable to create it.

I had gathered all these transparent image files of all iDevices that supported iOS 11 and above, so why let them go to waste?

These include all makes, models, and colors of iPhones, iPod Touches, and iPads that support iOS 11 and above.

The iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch, iOS, iMessage, and all images and logos included within this repository are owned by @Apple, and reserve all and any rights to modify the containing images and repository as they please.

Enjoy.
